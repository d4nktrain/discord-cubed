# scrambler
Scrambler is the original discord bot created for generating scrambles for twisty puzzles.
This project uses [Scrambo](https://github.com/nickcolley/scrambo) for some scrambles, and Redi Cube scrambles are provided by xyzzy, sourced [here](https://torchlight.github.io/rediscrambler.js). All other scrambles and commands were written by the scrambler dev team. 

## How to add the bot:
Simply click [here](https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=603602729805414480&permissions=130048&scope=bot) and select the server you would like to add it to! Scrambler is hosted on a dedicated server monitored by [TheUPSTruck](https://github.com/DiscordGod/). Make sure scrambler has permission to read and send messages in the channels you want to use it in.

## How to get started:
Once you add the bot to your server, simply run `s!help` for a list of all of the currently available commands. For the basic twisty puzzles, you can just run `s!<puzzle name>` (without the brackets). All officially recognized WCA events are featured currently, and other puzzles included can be found in the help command.

## Helpful commands
Scrambler has multiple useful tools for managing the use of the bot on your server. You can a choose a convenient prefix with `s!prefix`, and restrict the use of the bot in certain channels with `s!ignore`. Also, check out server competition tools with `s!compsettings`. For any of these commands, add the argument "help" afterwards with a space to get more information on usage of the command.
