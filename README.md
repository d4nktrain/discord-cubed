# scrambler
A Discord bot that generates scrambles for twisty puzzles.
This project uses [Scrambo](https://github.com/nickcolley/scrambo) for some scrambles, and Redi Cube scrambles are provided by xyzzy, sourced [here](https://torchlight.github.io/rediscrambler.js). 

## How to add the bot
Simply click [here](https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=423530119836073986&permissions=130048&scope=bot) and select the server you would like to add it to!

## How to get started
Once you add the bot to your server, simply run `s!help` for a list of all of the currently available commands. For the basic twisty puzzles, you can just run `s!<puzzle name>` (without the brackets). All officially recognized WCA events are featured currently, and other puzzles included can be found in the help command.

## Want to add a command or report a bug?
  - You can join the scrambler support server [here](https://discord.gg/GeQvStw) and report bugs or make suggestions in `#suggestions`
  - You can also suggest a command via the issue tracker, or a template has been provided at `src\template.js`.
